<h3>Social Contract</h3>

<p> The ultimate premise of the social contract is the definition of the relationship between an individual's freedom and state protection of the individual.
    Many thinkers have attempted to draw a line between the two in an attempt to identify the most "beneficial" balance. 
    Hobbesian thought believes in the need of an absolutist state to overcome the naturally selfish and violent individual whereas
    someone like Locke believes in the limitation of the state, empowered by the consent of its people, to support the natural rights of the individual.
    Importantly, the social contract's primary premise (the relationship between the indidvidual and the state) is heavily dependent on the innate qualities of humans.
    Logically, the need for a restrictive government will vary vastly depending on the people being governed.

    Therefore, I've broken down the social contract into a primary premise and a different, although dependent, seconday belief: 1. The relationship between the individual and the state and 2. Human Nature. See the explanatory graphic on the right.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
After clicking "Begin Quiz," the user is asked many multiple choice questions that, when combined, paint a relatively strong picture of the user's stance on the ideal social contract.
In an effort to prevent user bias, the questions may seem somewhat abstract or loaded -- this is intentional; simply answer to the best of your ability.

Once all the questions are answered, the website calculates a value for each of axis. These values (out of necessity) are relative. Consequently, in an attempt to contextualize your score, select points of famous thinkers are presented.
